Welcome to my repositore, my name is Augusto Fernández. I’m from La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
I study at Universidad Argentina De La Empresa School to see myself in the future with a Degree in Computer Systems.
I love technology, the way it helps us, entertains us and connects us every day. 
Nowadays I’m programming in the following technologies: Python, Java, SQL, Cobol.
